## Future Improvements

- Implement a direct messaging or comment feature to facilitate communication between event organizers and participants.

- Notify users when an event they have joined is updated or canceled to keep them informed.

- Refine the location input fields by adding sections for postal codes, street addresses, and other details to enhance accuracy.

- Allow organizers to upload images to showcase the venue and atmosphere, helping participants get a better sense of the event.
